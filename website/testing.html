        Much of the testing done was solely on materials, as the concept of preserving food has been well proven through many many years. 
        I chose 3 different metals to test, mild steel, galvanized steel, and aluminum 5052. I did 2 tests, one to measure the 
        ease of use, with a emphasis on current materials used in manufacturing, and a simulated environment test.
        <br />
        First was the environment test. I took a small sheet of each metal and left it exposed to the elements for several weeks. This was
        to test the worst case scenario, in which the cans are not kept in a place where they would be safe from environmental conditions. 
        There were no specific measurements taken, just effects over time observed.
        <br />
        Both the galvanized steel and aluminum showed no corrosion after testing. Both have corrosion-resistant properties, which makes them extremely
        viable for environments like this. There is potential for the galvanized steel to rust on surfaces where it has been cut, though this was not
        observed. The mild steel did show significant rusting. It was just surface rust, which could eventually flake off, resulting in material lost.
        The rust could also progress to where it is pitting, which also results in material lost. The rust becomes dangerous to any potential food
        stored inside the can, especially as material is lost and more material is exposed to air and oxidized. This makes
