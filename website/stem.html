        The largest parts of STEM used in this project were computer assisted design (CAD) and materials science. Both of these were crucial in determining the specific solution,
        size, and materials that would lead to the best results. For the materials science, much research was done into how cans have been made in the past, and drawing conclusions
        off of already existing innovation. This, along with other research and consideration, has made the choice of tin-electroplated steel obvious. Other materials will be tested,
        but the majority of the focus will be on steel, due to its specific properties. CAD was important for making the die used to produce the prototypes, as 3D printing allowed
        the creation of threads with accuracy, in order to properly test the prototypes.

        For the specific aspects of STEM used in each area. Science was used mostly in the area of the specific material choice, balancing strength with manufacturability and cost.
        Technology was used most significantly in CAD and 3D printing, utilizing technology for a smooth prototyping process. Technology is also shown in the proposed manufacturing 
        method, which builds on years of manufacturing technology that has been refined again and again. Engineering in the specific size choice, along with the use of already-existing
        materials, processes, and parts. This has allowed a much more efficent design process, as much of what is needed for the project is already in production, reducing costs
        and increasing feasibility.
