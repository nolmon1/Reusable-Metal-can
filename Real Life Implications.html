        While much of the reason for making this product was its use in humanitarian aid, it should
        do reasonably well in the civillian market too. The can was designed with this in mind. 
        It is unlikely that a product like this created solely for humanitarian aid will stay 
        afloat. Therefore, it was also designed with the intent to be sold extensively in the market,
        helping to fund these efforts and use the can in humanitarian aid. 
        <br />
        In recent years, there has been a huge push towards reuasbility and sustainability in consumer
        purchasing, and these cans fit in that category. They are designed to be reusable with minimal
        waste, completely recyclable, and maintain much of the processes already in place to manufacture
        normal cans. 
        <br />
        The majority of consumers that are already canning and preserving food are concerned about these
        issues of reusability and sustainability, which should increase the chance of the can succeeding in
        the consumer market. Success in the consumer market, while not guaranteed, is crucial to the ability to
        provide humanitarian aid.
