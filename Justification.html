        Because of the unique use case of this can, it must be able to be used for many cycles and a long period of time
        without failure. It must be durable, both to time and to potential rough handling. It must be able to store at least
        one meal's worth of food if prepared, or multiple servings of unprepared food. 
        <br />
        The primary stakeholders would be the users of the product, both end and intermediate.
        There would be some commercial sale of the can, which could support much of the cost involved
        with humanitarian work.
