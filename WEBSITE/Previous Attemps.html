        Humanitarian efforts are not new to this world. The want to help out those less fortunate is not unique. Because of the dense conditions found in South Asia, along with the lack of development,
        efforts to improve living conditions and development are common. In addition, the area is frequented by severe natural disasters, further hindering efforts
        <br />
        Some of the most prominent efforts are UNICEF, the United Nation's humanitarian wing; Oxfam, a non governmental organization with a strong wing in South Asia; and The Hunger Project, which
        seeks to end food insecurity worldwide. These efforts are working wonders for the area, but birth rates are still increasing, and there is less and less land available to sustain each person
        <br />
        This calls for more efficency in the use of land and the use of time in humanitarian efforts. As agricultural technology advances, the efficency of arable land increases, however, many of these
        innovations aren't accessible to individual or small farms due to the high cost of entry

        The biggest strength of current humanitarian efforts is the sheer size. With the amount of funding they recieve, they are able to do much, with many volunteers and coordinators. However,
        more efficency means moer can be done with the same amount of resources.

        Food preservation has been around for much time, and the widespreaad use of the can came about in the early 1900's. In that time, many improvements have been made in materials, in structure, and
        in consistency. However, not every step forward has been good progress. As polymers became a huge part of manufacturing, they came into all fields of production. This includes food and food
        packaging, where they are often used as complete packages, or some as coatings to prevent other packaging materials from touching and contaminating foods. However, one of the most popular
        coatings, Bisphenol-A, was recently banned from contact with food in the European Union. It is likely that other nations will follow suit in banning the material. It is unknown how companies
        will adapt to this, but this forces the companies to switch to a different coating. Bisphenol-A was found to break down, contaminate food, and have adverse effects in the body.
