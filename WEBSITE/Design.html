    <h1>The Super Can!</h1>

    The largest choice that affected the design process was the size of the can. Too large would
    limit usability and be harder to produce while still keeping already-in-production components.
    Too small would make it hard to use effectively and limit the capabilites of the can. Because of this,
    I decided on a can of a similar size to a normal wide-mouth mason jar, which allows adequate space,
    while still using lids and lid retainers that are already in production, reducing costs.

    There is the potential to move to different sizes, or to produce multiple sizes, making the product
    more versatile and allowing more varied uses, but the concept needs to be proven before that would be
    worth the investment. Some examples of what that could look like are shown here:

    The can must also be able to be manufactured in bulk in a similar method to how cans are already made.
    This isn't as constraining, as many of the features are the same as normal cans, however, the threads pose
    a unique challenge. Rolling threads is very possible, but there is a chance of distortion while the can
    is being rolled into its final circular shape. This can be avoided with a more gradual rolling process,
    which limits the stress on the threads and will keep them in shape for the final product. The main goal
    of the can is to be consistently reusable, so proper manufacturing of the threads is vital.
